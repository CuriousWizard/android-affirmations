# Android affirmations
This app was made after the following [Android Developer Codelab](https://developer.android.com/courses/pathways/android-basics-kotlin-unit-2-pathway-3).

## What I've learnt in this codelab

* Using RecyclerView for displaying scrollable list
* Using resource annotations to help ensure that the right type of resource ID is passed into a class constructor.
* Using the Material Components for Android library to have your app more easily follow the recommended Material Design guidelines.
* Using MaterialCardView to display content in a Material card.
